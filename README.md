# wholesaler
A simple wholesaler system.
Wholesaler performs the functions of collection and storage of goods, distribution, financing and risk taking. Retailers are the middlemen who buy goods from wholesalers or producers and sell them to consumers. They deal in goods in small quantities.
A wholesaler is an intermediary entity in the distribution channel that buys and sells to resellers rather than to consumers.
